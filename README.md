# Insight

#### _**See your client, understand your business**_

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

InSight is a **client relationship management (CRM)** desktop app built for
**small photography/videography businesses**. It helps creatives keep track of clients,
bookings, and trends — all in one simple, lightweight tool.

Unlike large enterprise CRMs that are expensive and bloated, or simple address books that
lack business context, InSight is tailored for creative professionals who want to:

* Manage contacts and booking history

* Track loyalty and client preferences

* Monitor trends and influencers

* Improve service delivery with context-aware communication

## 📸 About the Project

This project was developed as part of the CS2103T Software Engineering module at NUS.
InSight builds on the foundations of the se-edu AddressBook project, reimagined for creative
freelancers and small businesses who struggle with client information scattered across email,
WhatsApp, and spreadsheets.

InSight is written in Java, following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, and
comes with automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and developer documentation.

## 🔑 Key Features

* Add Client – Store client details (name, phone, email, social handles).
* List Clients – View all stored clients with summary details.
* Edit Client – Update client details anytime.
* Delete Client – Remove a client and their records.
* Search Clients – Find clients by name, email, or social handle.
* Add Booking – Record bookings with date, package, notes, and tags.
* View & Edit Bookings – Manage past and upcoming bookings.
* Tag Bookings – Organize by theme, package, or trend.
* Track Loyalty – See client frequency and history at a glance.
* Trend & Influencer Monitoring (Planned) – Keep shoots aligned with current market inspiration.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing
  contact details.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Stories

  email.
